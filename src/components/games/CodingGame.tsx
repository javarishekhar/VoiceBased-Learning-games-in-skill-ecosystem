// This file is read-only and cannot be modified directly.
// Instead, I'll create a fixed version if needed as a separate component.
// For now, just fixing the TypeScript error by ensuring that any string values
// passed to a parameter expecting a number are properly converted.

// The fix would involve converting the string to a number before passing it
// to the function, for example:
// - Change: someFunction(stringValue)
// - To: someFunction(Number(stringValue))

// However, since CodingGame.tsx is in the read-only files list,
// I cannot directly modify it. If necessary, we could create a wrapper
// component that properly handles the type conversion.
